# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this module we developed a weather dashboard using the openweather API. We made calls using a city name to get the current weather as well as the next five days. 

## Usage

To make the openweather api work with a direct search, I utilized the geocoding api to convert the input of a city name and country code into latitude and longitude. With that I took their current day api and their five day forecast api and displayed the temperature, humidity, wind, date, and a weather icon on the page. With each search I appended a button that would re run the function for each city to have another look at the user search history.
